With a mainstream career of only 4 years, Jimi Hendrix's influence on music can still be heard today. He changed how people play the electric guitar, turing feedback and distortion into an art form. Hendrix is known for the combining of rock and roll with the blues, and for playing rhythm guitar like no one before. His most famous performance was at Woodstock in 1969. During his rendition of the star spangled banner, he used the whammy bar and distortion to simulate the sounds of jet fighters, machine guns, and bombs. Only a year after this performance, he died from an accidental drug overdose at 27 years old.

Ludwig van Beethoven, born in December 17, 1770, was one of the most famous musicians ever to have lived. Unlike most other musicians (who's music can be firmly placed in one music era), Beethoven lived during the transition between the Classical and Romantic music period. Beethoven's first music teacher was his father. One could potentially argue that his music played a hand in transitioning the style of western music. Classical music, at the time, was recognized for its complexity and grandiosity. While Beethoven had composed pieces that conformed to this style, his later work demonstrated the more emotional and unstable style that he is most recognized for today.
